# How to set up the application
We suggest to set up a virtual environment to run the application since the packages may cause conflicts with other applications. In order to do so we encourage you to use jetbrains pycharm IDE as it automatically detects python's virtual enviroments and installs requirements.
After installing all the requirements, you can run the application by running the following commands.

#### RUN BACKEND
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

#### RUN FRONTEND
```bash
cd ./frontend/src
npm i
npm run dev
```
